In my Doom reinforcement learning project, I worked with different environments that presented unique challenges. Each environment came with its own predefined reward system, which meant I had to adapt and work with the existing reward structures.

To preprocess the data and optimize the models' learning, I applied a grayscale filter to the frames. This filtering technique helped eliminate unnecessary information and allowed the models to focus on the most relevant aspects of the environment.

During the training process, the most significant number of steps I encountered was 560,000, achieved by a single model. This milestone served as a measure of the complexity and difficulty I faced in that particular environment.

To implement the reinforcement learning algorithm, I utilized the PPO algorithm with the CNNPolicy variant. PPO is a widely used algorithm that strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation to maximize rewards.
